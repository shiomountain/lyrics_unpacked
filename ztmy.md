<!-- 標準的な言い方は"Benkyo shite(勉強して)"だが，以下の点で異なる．
"お"を先頭につけるのは"O-ryouri(お料理)"，"O-keshou(お化粧)"のように丁寧な言い方．しかし，勉強に"お"をつけるのは通例，大人が子供に言い聞かせる様な尊大な言い方．"Shitoiteyo" は指示の意味だが，勝手に自分でやっといてくれというニュアンスを含んでいる． -->
Title: The standard way to say the title is "Benkyo shite" (study), but it differs in the following points.
Adding "O" at the beginning is a polite way of saying a word e.g. "O-ryouri (cooking)" or "O-keshou (makeup)". However, adding "O" to "benkyo" (study) sounds like an adult talking to a child.
"Shitoiteyo" means "instruction," but it also includes the nuance of "do it on your own", and "it's easy, isn't it". Another example is "O-sentaku shitoiteyo" (do the laundry) from wife to husband.
<!-- 彼女は彼のことが好きだが，悩んでおり，感情が不安定になっていてそれを自覚している．一歩踏み出したいが，うじうじ悩んで色んな感情が錯綜している -->
Description: She likes him, but she is troubled, emotionally unstable and aware of it. She wants to take a step forward, but she is having a hard time and is having mixed feelings. As is often the case in ztmy, homonyms often appear.
Tense: Most lyrics are written in the present tense. Some part like "Osentaku shita"(do laundry) and "Sodatechatta kanjo" (emotion that I nurtured) seems present perfect.
Lyrics: "Shitsu no ii yami kanjou ga afureta toki no." A sentence ending with the noun in "Shitsu no ii yami." "Yami" is a noun usually used to describe an illness, but here it refers to a bad mental state. "Shitsu no ii" refers to a good quality, which may be a positive attitude in a bad state.
"Shou ga nai" means there is no "shiyou (仕様, way)," and is often used when there is no way.
The "i" in "Kawakanaiya(かわかないや)" is not sung, but sounds like "kawakanaya(かわかなや) ".
"mottaibutte iikara." "Mottaiburu" is like handling with great care and is not releasing easily.
The "kono manma" appears three times, but the kanji for "ko" is different each time: the first time is "fox (狐)," the next time is "single unit (個)," and the last time is "child (子)". The fox, along with the racoon dog(たぬき), is an animal believed to possess supernatural powers in Japan, and statues of the fox are often seen at shrines.
"hakattoite" appears twice. The first time it means "to plot (謀っといて)" and the second time it means "to plan (図っといて)." The first is a Kanji character also used for intrigue.
"Atsume chatta kanjo sankosho desu". "Atsumechatta (collected)" is the standard way to say "Atsumeta (collected)", and includes the casual nuance that you have done something that you don't need to.
"kanjo sankosho" means emotional reference books and sounds like textbooks used in exams.

Title: "Zanki(残機)" originally means remaining planes in shooting game.
Tense: She sings in a mixture of present and past tenses. The past tense is used, for example, in "Tanjunmeikai deshita" and "warai takatta."
Location: It has the lyrics "Sanjikai(3次会)", which is the third restaurant of a "Nomikai(飲み会)" which is an event where several people go to restaurants to drink alcohol. Some of the lyrics such as "Kaettesuguni(帰ってすぐに, right after getting home)" can be read as scenes after returning home from a "Nomikai".
Description: As is often the case in ztmy, homonyms often appear. In particular, homonyms of words associated with the preceding lyrics are frequently used.
Lyrics: "iya(嫌)" sounds like yeah but means opposite.
"kurattatte(喰らったって)" refers to the fact that she is damaged. Another example is "damage wo kurau (ダメージを喰らう)."
"Ninniku mashi(ニンニク増し)" is an option used at the famous "jiro" ramen restaurant in Japan to add more garlic. An option to stay healthy.
"harauta(腹歌)" is one letter different from "hanauta(鼻歌)", which means humming.
"Mou jouto(もう譲渡)" is sung in places where one might say "Mou chotto(もうちょっと)", which means "a little more," and their pronunciations are similar.
<!-- sounds like "Mouchotto(もうちょっと)", which means a little bit more. -->
"Rettoukan mou(劣等感妄)". "Mou(妄)" has the same sound as the adverb "mou(もう, already)" at the beginning of a sentence, and is usually used at the end of a sentence as an exclamation (もう！). Like "iya(嫌)" at the beginning of this song, the same sounding Kanji character (妄) is used.
"Sanjikai(さんじかい)" appears twice, the first time as "Sanjikai(惨事会)," which is a coined word combining "Sanji(惨事)," which refers to a terrible event such as a murder, and "Kai(会)," which means a meeting.
The second one is "Sanjikai(3次会)", which is the third restaurant of a "Nomikai(飲み会)" which is an event where several people go to restaurants to drink alcohol.
"Motto motto?(モットーもっと？) " The English word "motto" has the same pronunciation as the Japanese word for "more (もっと, motto)," and there is a famous song called "motto". https://open.spotify.com/track/5puJw2GWfVu8h3ypGuo2Sn?si=567aa83d90eb4fc2
"Arigataki(有り難き)" is an old way of saying thank you. The nouns that follow are omitted, should be something like "Aragataki shiawase(ありがたき幸せ, Great pleasure for me)."
"Agan nakute(上がんなくて)" probably refers to not being in a good mood. Often used in Japanese Hip Hop or dance music.
Examples include "Agattenno(上がってんの)" in https://open.spotify.com/track/6bAvsgAUTQlN3y47Ow8EEC?si=d99c7dfe150940d5, and "Kibun jojo(気分上々)" in https://open.spotify.com/track/7tkfkqKfWtU1GIoV9IY9rQ?si=53a83a5f936a4185
"Goaiko ja(ご愛顧じゃ)" should be a replacement for "Oaikoja (おあいこじゃ)." The latter is one character different from the former and means you get even in "Janken(じゃんけん)" or rock-paper-scissors-scissors.
"Kimochi ina(気持ちいな)" One "i(い)" is omitted compared to the standard form "kimochi ii na(気持ち良いな)". The song starts with "iya(嫌)" or feeling bad and ends with "ii na(良いな)" or feeling good.
